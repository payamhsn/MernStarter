# MERN Stack Starter Template

## Overview

This is a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack starter template. It provides a solid foundation for building full-stack web applications with modern technologies and best practices. This template includes user authentication (registration, login, and logout functionality) and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Features

- User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout)
- MongoDB integration for data persistence
- React frontend with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Express backend with modular architecture
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable styling
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- RESTful API design
- Protected routes for authenticated users

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**

  - React
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for API requests
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Vite as the build tool

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB for database
  - Mongoose for object modeling
  - bcryptjs for password hashing
  - jsonwebtoken for JWT implementation

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-starter.git
   cd mern-stack-starter
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string and `your_jwt_secret` with a secure random string.

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

   ```
   cd backend
   npm run server
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available on `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application running.

### Usage

- Register a new user account
- Log in with your credentials
- Access protected routes (e.g., dashboard)
- Log out when finished
